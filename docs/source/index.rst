What is ``SpatialLeiden``?
==========================

SpatialLeiden is an implementation of
`Multiplex Leiden clustering <https://leidenalg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/multiplex.html>`_
that can be used to cluster spatially resolved transcriptomics data.

SpatialLeiden integrates with the `scverse <https://scverse.org/>`_ by leveraging
`scanpy <https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/>`_ and `anndata <https://anndata.readthedocs.io/>`_
but can also be used independently.
